Dev Repo for our Engr E222 Final Project

# Project Proposal

For this project we have chosen to work with Beat Saber map statistics to predict the reception of a map uploaded to the community repository, https://beatsaver.com/.

The repository has a web api that we will interact with to get characteristics of each map.

We plan to utilize the following characteristics:
* Song BPM
* Song Length
* Amount of:
  * Difficulties
  * Notes
  * Bombs
  * Obstacles (Walls)
  * NJS (Note Jump Speed) and Offset

To predict the reception of the map. Upvotes/Downvotes or a ratio between them.
